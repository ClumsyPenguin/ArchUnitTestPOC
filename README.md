# Proof of Concept: Enforcing Tests on Cached Types with ArchUnitNet

## Overview
This repository serves as a proof of concept (POC) for demonstrating the capability of enforcing that every cached type within a software architecture is adequately tested. This is achieved by utilizing the ArchUnitNet library, a powerful tool for enforcing architectural rules in .NET applications.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this POC is to showcase how the ArchUnitNet library can be used to ensure that all cached types are subjected to rigorous testing protocols. This enforcement helps maintain high code quality and ensures that key architectural requirements are met.

## ArchUnitNet
ArchUnitNet is a library designed to enforce architectural governance in .NET projects. It allows developers to write tests that validate code against defined architectural standards. In this POC, ArchUnitNet is used to verify that all cached types have corresponding tests, ensuring that they behave as expected under various conditions.

## Getting Started
To get started with this POC, clone the repository and follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the repository directory.
2. Build the project using your favorite .NET-compatible IDE or the .NET CLI.
3. Run the tests to see ArchUnitNet in action, enforcing that all cached types does have a test.
